\section*{Statement of Purpose}

I started programming at an early age. This provided me with the opportunity
to experience some influential platforms/technologies, like
\textit{Commodore~64} or \textit{Sinclair~Spectrum} and rather modern ones
like \textit{VB6} or \textit{Turbo~C++}. I've been using \textit{C\#} and
\textit{.NET} since their early days, and soon found myself being passionate
about \textit{Object-Oriented Programming} and began exploring books and
articles (mostly on \textit{The~Code~Project} then) on design patterns,
application architecture, clean coding and experimenting ideas and
self-thoughts.

In the late 2000's, relational databases attracted my attention more than
before. Since then, I occasionally read on database design and other
concepts on the topic and try to make a point of following standards on my
projects.

Out of workplace, I actively provide consult to governmental or personal
software projects. In my spare time, I'm a curious learner and a developer who
is passionate about \textit{C\#}/\textit{TypeScript} and occasionally
contributes to open-source projects. My last but not least interest is
creating technical content based on day-to-day experience. I
occasionally share my thoughts on my personal blog at
\href{https://babakks.github.io}{Github} and
\href{https://dev.to/babakks}{DEV}.

Currently, I'm a senior software engineer at
\href{https://cafebazaar.ir}{\emph{Cafebazaar}}, the \textit{largest}
Iranian Android app store%
\footnote{\label{cb-on-wiki}%
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe\_Bazaar}{Cafebazaar on Wikipedia}}%
and one of the top third-party app markets world-wide%
\footnote{\label{3rd-party-stores-on-wiki}%
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_mobile\_app\_distribution\_platforms\#Third-party\_platforms}%
    {Third-party Android app markets on Wikipedia}},
developing high-load web services in \textit{Go} and \textit{Python}.

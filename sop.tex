\section*{Statement of Purpose}

I started programming at an early age. This provided me with the opportunity
to experience some influential platforms/technologies, like
\textit{Commodore~64} or \textit{Sinclair~Spectrum} and rather modern ones
like \textit{VB6} or \textit{Turbo~C++}. I've been using \textit{C\#} and
\textit{.NET} since their early days, and soon found myself being passionate
about \textit{Object-Oriented Programming} and began exploring books and
articles (mostly on \textit{The~Code~Project} then) on design patterns,
application architecture, clean coding and experimenting ideas and
self-thoughts. Relational databases are another area of interest for me.

To summarize myself into a minium set of attributes I would say I'm a
continuous learner who hugely values technical quality. So, a job position with
lots of learning opportunities and a never-ceasing attention regard technical
qualities makes the ideal work that I could imagine. Due to this pure technical
mindset, I think, I'd be a better fit for foundational companies/projects where
their products are software platforms/systems/tools that empower other
businesses.

Currently, I mostly write code in Golang, Python, and TypeScript, and also
contribute to open source projects, including (but not limited to) Microsoft
TypeScript and VS Code.

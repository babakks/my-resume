\section*{Statement of Purpose}

I started programming at an early age. This provided me with the opportunity
to experience some influential platforms/technologies, like
\textit{Commodore~64} or \textit{Sinclair~Spectrum} and rather modern ones
like \textit{VB6} or \textit{Turbo~C++}. I've been using \textit{C\#} and
\textit{.NET} since their early days, and soon found myself being passionate
about \textit{Object-Oriented Programming} and began exploring books and
articles (mostly on \textit{The~Code~Project} then) on design patterns,
application architecture, clean coding and experimenting with ideas/thoughts.
Relational databases are another area of interest for me.

To summarize myself into a minimum set of attributes I would say I'm a
continuous learner who hugely values technical quality. So, a job position with
lots of learning opportunities and a never-ceasing attention to technical
quality makes the ideal work that I could imagine. Due to this mindset, I think,
I'd be a better fit for companies/projects where their products are software
platforms/systems/tools that empower other businesses.

Currently, I live in the UK and primarily write code in Golang, Python, and
TypeScript. I value open-source software, and in my spare time I contribute to
some projects, including, but not limited to, Microsoft TypeScript and
VS Code and related tools, and GitHub CLI. Over time, I've developed a number
of VS Code extensions to improve developers' productivity/experience.

    \noindent
    I started programming at an early age. This provided me with the opportunity
    to experience some influential platforms/technologies, like
    \textit{Commodore~64} or \textit{Sinclair~Spectrum} and rather modern ones
    like \textit{VB6} or \textit{Turbo~C++}. I've been using \textit{C\#} and
    \textit{.NET} since their early days, and soon found myself being passionate
    about \textit{Object-Oriented Programming} and began exploring books and
    articles (mostly on \textit{The~Code~Project} then) on design patterns,
    application architecture, clean coding and experimenting ideas and
    self-thoughts.

    In the late 2000's, relational databases attracted my attention more than
    before. Since then, I occasionally read on database design and other
    concepts on the topic and try to make a point of following standards on my
    projects. I also have hands on experience on leveraging \textit{NoSQL} or
    \textit{key/value~pair} databases.

    Out of workplace, I actively provide consult to governmental or personal
    software projects. In my spare time, I'm curious learner and a developer who
    is passionate about \textit{C\#}/\textit{TypeScript} and occasionally
    contributes to open-source projects. My last but not least interest is
    creating technical content based on day-to-day experiences, which I
    currently follow through sharing on my personal weblog at
    \href{https://babakks.github.io}{Github} and
    \href{https://dev.to/babakks}{DEV}.

    Currently, I'm a senior software engineer at
    \href{https://cafebazaar.ir}{\emph{Cafebazaar}}, the \textit{largest}
    Iranian Android app store%
    \footnote{\label{cb-on-wiki}%
        \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe\_Bazaar}{Cafebazaar on Wikipedia}}%
    and one of the top third-party app markets world-wide%

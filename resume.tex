\noindent
I started programming at an early age. This provided me with the opportunity to
experience some influential platforms/technologies, like \textit{Commodore~64}
or \textit{Sincalir~Spectrum} and rather modern ones like \textit{VB6} or
\textit{Turbo~C++}. I've been using \textit{C\#} and \textit{.NET}
since their early days, and soon found myself being passionate about
\textit{Object-Oriented Programming} and began exploring books and articles
(mostly on \textit{The~Code~Project} then) on design patterns, application
architecture, clean coding  and experimenting ideas and self-thoughts.

In 2008, relational databases attracted my attention more than before. Since
then, I occasionally read on database design and other concepts on the topic and
try to make a point of following standards on my projects. Also, I've hands on \
experience on leveraging \textit{NoSQL} or \textit{key/value~pair} databases.

Thanks to my past and the wide range of technologies that I've explored, I've
developed a good sense of judgment about current/future platforms/technologies
and beware of those mainstream trends that recreate old mistakes/lessons or
those may come to an end in a near future.

Currently, I'm leading a \textit{.NET} development team at
\href{www.partdp.ir}{\textit{Part Software Group}}.
Also, I actively provide consult to governmental or personal
software projects. In my spare time, I'm a full-stack web/\textit{Windows} developer
who is passionate about \textit{TypeScript} and occasionally contributes to
open-source projects.
